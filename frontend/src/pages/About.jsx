          This idea was originally inspired by experiments done by the Monroe Institute
          and the CIA in the 1980s. The program, the "Gateway Experiments" explored conscious enhancement, remote
          viewing, and altered states for intelligence gathering through hemi-sync,
          which is induced by binaural beats. Hemi-sync is the idea of syncing your
          left and right brain hemispheres together.
